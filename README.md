Building AI Course Project Idea - Medical pre-diagnosis for pathologies with image scanning tools (X-rays, CT, MRI, ultrasound)

## Medical pre-diagnosis for pathologies with image scanning tools (X-rays, CT, MRI, ultrasound)
Taking as training data the historial of images obtained with the various current technologies, develop an automatic image processing system that allows to establish patterns and link them with diagnoses, so that an automatic pre-diagnosis can be obtained once verified and tested. The model will allow doctors to confirm or adjust the results and thus provide feedback.
On the other hand, through a method of NLP Natural Language Processing, Categorize and obtain patterns between the diagnostic reports of all medical imaging tests/systems.
Another proposal is to maintain, through an NLP, a continuous search in journals and specialized medical sources to have the latest advances in the identified diagnoses and to offer updated information in the reports.
Finally, all this information could be transferred to multiple languages through Transformer Networks techniques.

## Background
The main idea is to provide a pre-diagnosis through AI that deepens and contrasts much more information than a human can possess.
Many times the human factor does not have enough time or skill to interpret all the details of medical scaning tests, having the help of AI to obtain a pre-diagnosis would facilitate and reduce possible human errors.
I think that the interpretation of certain tests that are routine is a perfect field to implement AI, it is not about replacing the human factor, but about giving you new tools to improve your work.

## How is it used?
This project could generate global knowledge about certain diagnostic processes, applicable throughout the healthcare and hospital community around the world. The main users would be doctors and the main beneficiaries would be patients first, then hospitals and health systems, since resources would be optimized and they would be more efficient, improving current techniques and expanding the analysis capacity with new techniques. At the end a global improvement for society and humanity.

## Data sources and AI methods
The anonymized data would be collected from the databases of health institutions, whether public or private.

## Challenges
Obviously the data must be anonymised, the ideal would be to start with a pilot project, it would also be necessary to take into account the laws and characteristics of each country.A previous work of analysis, parameterization and filtering of sensitive information would be necessary to be able to limit the necessary data as well as the reliability of the same.

## What next?
Taking into account that my programming skills are zero and that I am a neophyte in all these knowledge, to launch the project I would need all the necessary help, I only have the idea, which I have briefly outlined in this document, I know that there are many more requirements to carry it out but maybe this is not the forum, is it?
Surely this idea is not new and many projects are being worked on throughout the world, I just don't know where they are ... If anyone has knowledge of them, I would be grateful if you could send it to me.

## Acknowledgments
Inspiration has come to me from a need to help people, who does not know a close case where a misdiagnosis has had fatal results? Automating and combining the wide knowledge of the scientific community around the world, saving linguistic and cultural peculiarities is a challenge that we must face.
If we are able to put AI to work in generating a broader knowledge than human beings can process by themselves, it will allow us to continue growing as a species and as a society

## Thanks
Thanks to Reaktor and the University of Helsinki for sharing and offering everyone the chance to introduce us to this world of AI. Sharing knowledge not only improves society but also makes us happier and allows us to continue evolving and growing towards a better future.
