Building AI Course Project Idea - Medical pre-diagnosis for pathologies with image scanning tools (X-rays, CT, MRI, ultrasound)

## Medical pre-diagnosis for pathologies with image scanning tools (X-rays, CT, MRI, ultrasound)
Taking as training data the historial of images obtained with the various current technologies, develop an automatic image processing system that allows to establish patterns and link them with diagnoses, so that an automatic pre-diagnosis can be obtained once verified and tested. The model will allow doctors to confirm or adjust the results and thus provide feedback.
On the other hand, through a method of NLP Natural Language Processing, Categorize and obtain patterns between the diagnostic reports of all medical imaging tests/systems.
Another proposal is to maintain, through an NLP, a continuous search in journals and specialized medical sources to have the latest advances in the identified diagnoses and to offer updated information in the reports.
Finally, all this information could be transferred to multiple languages through Transformer Networks techniques.

## Background

Which problems does your idea solve? How common or frequent is this problem? What is your personal motivation? Why is this topic important or interesting?

This is how you make a list, if you need one:
* problem 1
* problem 2
* etc.


## How is it used?

Describe the process of using the solution. In what kind situations is the solution needed (environment, time, etc.)? Who are the users, what kinds of needs should be taken into account?

Images will make your README look nice!
Once you upload an image to your repository, you can link link to it like this (replace the URL with file path, if you've uploaded an image to Github.)
![Cat](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Sleeping_cat_on_her_back.jpg)

If you need to resize images, you have to use an HTML tag, like this:
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Sleeping_cat_on_her_back.jpg" width="300">

This is how you create code examples:
```
def main():
   countries = ['Denmark', 'Finland', 'Iceland', 'Norway', 'Sweden']
   pop = [5615000, 5439000, 324000, 5080000, 9609000]   # not actually needed in this exercise...
   fishers = [1891, 2652, 3800, 11611, 1757]

   totPop = sum(pop)
   totFish = sum(fishers)

   # write your solution here

   for i in range(len(countries)):
      print("%s %.2f%%" % (countries[i], 100.0))    # current just prints 100%

main()
```


## Data sources and AI methods
Where does your data come from? Do you collect it yourself or do you use data collected by someone else?
If you need to use links, here's an example:
[Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs)

| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Header      | Title       |
| Paragraph   | Text        |

## Challenges

What does your project _not_ solve? Which limitations and ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying a solution like this?

## What next?

How could your project grow and become something even more? What kind of skills, what kind of assistance would you  need to move on?
